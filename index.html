            “The American landscape was once graced with resplendent public
            swimming pools, some big enough to hold thousands of swimmers at a
            time…. Officials envisioned the distinctly American phenomenon of
            the grand public resort pools as ‘social melting pots.’ Like free
            public grade schools, public pools were part of an ‘Americanizing’
            project intended to overcome ethnic divisions and cohere a common
            identity—and it worked…. Of course, that vision of classlessness
            wasn’t expansive enough to include skin color that wasn’t, in fact,
            ‘all the same’" (23).

          <p>
            Public pools, like the one in Oak Park in Montgomery, Alabama, used
            to be commonplace throughout the United States. But when Black
            families began demanding access to the public benefits their taxes
            were funding, towns opted to drain their pools rather than integrate
            them. As these grand, resort-like pools began closing across the
            country, white policymakers demonstrated that they would rather lose
            benefits for everyone than afford them to Black people.

        <p>
          Throughout <em>The Sum of Us</em>, Heather McGhee showed how time and
          again, America opted to drain the (metaphorical) pool of public
          benefits for everyone instead of allowing Black people access. From
          housing to healthcare to education to incarceration, America suffers
          from a lack of public benefits despite our uniquely advanced economy,
          and white people refuse to support public policy that would benefit
          them because it would also benefit Black people. The zero-sum story
          that progress for Black Americans must come at the expense of white
          Americans keeps us all from enjoying the healthcare, education, and
          democracy that the nation's ideals suggest. And until we address the
          fact that racism can be found at the heart of each of these seemingly
          unconnected issues, we will continue living in the bottom of a drained
          pool.

            “In the seventeenth century, influential Europeans were starting to
            create taxonomies of human beings based on skin color, religion,
            culture, and geography, aiming not just to differentiate but to rank
            humanity in terms of inherent worth. This hierarchy—backed by
            pseudo-scientists, explorers, and even clergy—gave Europeans moral
            permission to exploit and enslave. So, from the United States’
            colonial beginnings, progress for those considered white did come
            directly at the expense of people considered nonwhite. The U.S.
            economy depended on systems of exploitation—on literally taking land
            and labor from racialized others to enrich white colonizers and
            slaveholders. This made it easy for the powerful to sell the idea
            that the inverse was also true: that liberation or justice for
            people of color would necessarily require taking something away
            from white people” (7).

            Racism is baked into every facet of American society, from the
            colonial origins of the nation—racism was used to justify stolen
            people, labor, and land—to our history of discrimination,
            segregation, and racial violence, to the current systems of
            healthcare, incarceration, higher education, etc. that are
            disproportionately harmful to Black people. This is no accident:
            for generations, the wealthy ruling class has capitalized on racist
            stereotypes to divide and conquer the working classes, pitting
            against each other people who would all benefit from improved public
            benefits.

            We are inundated with unquestioned and stereotypical messages that
            shape how we think and what we believe about ourselves and others.
            What makes this "brainwashing" even more insidious is the fact that
            it is woven into every structural thread of the fabric of our
            culture. The media... our language patterns, the lyrics to songs,
            our cultural practices and holidays, and the very assumptions on
            which our society is built all contribute to the reinforcement of
            the biased messages and stereotypes we receive.

          One of the most powerful influencers of individual and group belief
          systems in America—religion—is also responsible for maintaining
          mindsets of white supremacy. When Christian settlers came to America,
          they could not justify their actions towards Indigenous people and
          Africans if they were considered to be people "made in the image of
          God." So instead, Christians decided that they were not humans made
          in the image of God, that white people were, and that the stealing of
          land, labor, and people was justified. "It's this history of the
          American church's complicity with white supremacy that explains why,
          today, white Christians are about 30 percentage points more likely to
          hold racially resentful and otherwise racist views than religiously
          unaffiliated white people" (248).

            Since this original lie, American governments have repeatedly used
            race as a justification for discriminatory, oppressive action
            towards Black people at the benefit of white people. When racial
            resentment evolved from biological racism ("it's about who they
            are") to cultural disapproval ("it's about what most of them do"),
            the story shifted to be "colorblind." This story takes many forms:
            antigovernment ideologies (that are implicitly pro-white) paint
            white people as victims of a thieving government giving their money
            to "undeserving and lazy people of color in the ghettos" (32);
            politicians use terms like "forced busing" and "states' rights" and
            "cutting taxes" to disguise policies that cause disproportionate
            suffering to Black people; colleges require you to pay for school
            out of pocket, but family wealth is rooted in history, and Black
            families were historically denied the same wealth as white families;
            etc.

        </div>
        <p>
          Even now, the zero-sum mindset of racism is present and dangerous.
          It has led white people to exclude Black people from social circles,
          schools, unions, neighborhoods, and mortgage markets, despite the
          fact that they are dragging themselves down too. The systemic
          oppression of minority groups are causing suffering for all of us but
          the wealthy one percent, and until we address the racism at the heart
          of these issues, we cannot progress.

          The list of ways we have drained the pool is long, but one of the most
          important (and most controversial) examples is public college.

        <div class="image-row">
          <img src="https://www.earnest.com/blog/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cost-of-college-keeps-rising.jpg" alt="Costs of college have risen steadily since 1975">
          <p>
            When the college-attending population was primarily white in the
            1940s, '50s, and '60s, state and federal government funds were
            widely available to pay for the expenses of higher education. As the
            demographics of the American public became more diverse, state
            governments began drastically reducing funding for public college.
            As tuition has steadily increased since the late 20th century,
            student debt has skyrocketed, leaving millions of students
            struggling to pay off student loans.
          </p>
        </div>
        <span class="quote">
          <p>
            “Because wealth is largely shaped by how much money your parents and
            grandparents had, Black young adults’ efforts at higher education
            and higher earnings aren’t putting much of a dent in the racial
            wealth gap. This generation was born too late for the free ride,
            and student loan repayment is making it even harder for Black
            graduates’ savings and assets to catch up. In fact, white high
            school dropouts have higher average household wealth than Black
            people who’ve graduated from college.
            <br>
            <br>
            As with so many economic ills, student debt is most acute among
            Black families, but it has now reached 63 percent of white public
            college graduates as well and is having ripple effects across our
            entire economy” (43).

            When public college was a mark of pride for the American public,
            states "saw a return of three to four dollars back for every dollar
            [they] invested in public colleges" (42). But public policy changes
            forged from a zero-sum mindset of racism created a new
            "debt-for-diploma" system. Since federal and state funding for
            public college has decreased, younger generations are left with
            less wealth and fewer ways to increase it. They cannot buy a home
            (the "irreplaceable wealth-building asset"), they get married later,
            and they have less saved for retirement later in life. The economic
            returns we used to see from a well-educated public have vanished.

            There’s this one example, from 1931, where a light-skinned black man
            gets into a car accident, and he’s taken to a white hospital. It’s
            Grady Memorial Hospital. This is in Atlanta. And doctors there, they
            mistake him for a white patient, so they start treating him. And
            it’s only when his family comes to the hospital that they realize
            he’s actually black. So what do they do? They pull him off the
            examining table and they send him to the black ward across the
            street, where he later dies.

          Stories like the one Hannah-Jones recalls were not rare occurrences
          post-emancipation; racism has had a strong grasp on American
          healthcare for decades. Black women are three times more likely to
          die of causes related to pregnancy than white women. Black people
          with H.I.V. get worse care than white people with the disease. Black
          patients with diabetes fared worse than white patients, even with the
          same doctor. Black Americans die at higher rates from cancers that
          would have been treatable had they been caught earlier. These
          statistics are a result of repeated systemic failures of our
          healthcare system to adequately care for Black people. And it's
          bringing all of us down.

        <span class="quote">

            “The story of America’s healthcare dysfunction comes back to the
            pool. Health insurers use that exact term when they refer to the
            number of people in the ‘risk pool’ of a plan…. Whether we’re
            talking about insurance or drug trials or vaccines or practice
            improvements, in health, the key is getting everybody in.
            Healthcare works best as a collective endeavor, and that’s at the
            heart of why America’s system performs so poorly. We’ve resisted
            universal solutions because when it comes to healthcare… racism has
            stopped us from ever filling the pool in the first place” (49).

            In theory, as the number of participants in a health insurance plan
            increases, the cost of that plan decreases as there are more people
            to contribute to the plan. It follows that in order to provide
            healthcare to everyone without requiring people to pay huge
            premiums, we need to have everyone participating and contributing
            to a plan. Under Obamacare, states had the opportunity to expand
            Medicaid. The federal government would pay the full cost for a few
            years and reduce to ninety percent into the future. States that
            <em>did</em> expand Medicaid saw the uninsured population diminish
            and rural clinics thrive. Obviously, the incentives to expand
            Medicaid under Obamacare were plentiful.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Yet again, the zero-sum story of racism prevents everyone from
          enjoying public benefits. Researchers at the University of Chicago
          found that "as the percent of the black population increases, the
          likelihood of adoption [of Medicaid] decreases" (qtd. in McGhee 57).
          As the "public" becomes more diverse, made up in larger part by
          nonwhite groups, white policymakers choose to reduce and eliminate
          public benefits. The reasoning is rooted in racism: claims that Black
          people are undeserving, lazy, freeloading the benefits paid for by
          hard-earned white taxpayer dollars discouraged support for expansion
          of Medicaid, even among the groups that would benefit most from its
          adoption (out of fear of being subject to racist stereotypes). So
          despite the possible benefits from universal healthcare or the
          expansion of Medicaid, white racist attitudes towards Black people is
          causing everyone to suffer.

            The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with
            stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are
            incomplete. They make one story become the only story.

            The zero-sum story of racism was a central concern throughout
            <em>The Sum of Us</em>. It is a belief rooted in the history of
            American culture, religion, and public policy. It is ingrained in
            the hearts and minds of millions of Americans, both those who make
            public policy and those who are subject to it, such that they would
            rather drain the pool of public benefits than integrate it because
            they believe progress for people of color must mean the opposite for
            them. Time and time again, wealthy elites advertise the zero-sum
            story as the core narrative of American society, inculcating
            antigovernment, anti-immigration, and anti-welfare sentiment even in
            those who would gain the most from the public benefits they are
            taught to advocate against. And time and time again, <em>all</em>
            Americans are left to suffer because of a lack of commitment to
            improving the quality of life for everyone. McGhee uses the example
            of climate change, a topic with "life-or-death" consequences, to
            demonstrate the explicit dangers of the zero-sum story.

            "Climate change opposition is sold by an organized, self-interested
            white elite to a broader base of white constituents already racially
            primed to distrust government action. The claims are racially
            innocent—we won't risk the economy for this dubious idea—but those
            using them are willing to take immense risks that might fall on
            precisely the historically exploited: people of color and the
            land, air, animals, and water. Like the zero-sum story, it's all an
            illusion—white men aren't truly safe from climate risk, and we can
            have a different but sustainable economy with a better quality of
            life for more people. But how powerful the zero-sum paradigm must
            be to knock out science and even a healthy sense of
            self-preservation. And how dangerous for us all" (205-206).

            Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie effectively articulated that the danger of
            one story being advertised, marketed, and enforced in every facet of
            society lies in its progression to becoming the <em>only</em> story
            in our society. And when the dominant narrative of our society is
            the zero-sum story, the consequences are dire. People are willing to
            go to extreme lengths to maintain their status in the racial
            hierarchy established by the wealthy ruling class and enforced by
            the zero-sum story despite the ways this harms and limits them.

            McGhee begins her book with the question, "why can't we have nice
            things?" As long as we subscribe to the zero-sum story, all of the
            nice things" we want—living wages, robust public health systems,
            adequately funded schools—are unattainable.

          By now, it is overwhelmingly apparent that the zero-sum story of
          racism runs deep in our history, our institutions, and our belief
          systems. It is abundantly clear that there are far-reaching,
          calamitous consequences for all of us if it continues to be the
          dominant narrative. And it is obviously imperative that we must
          begin to make changes if we want to achieve a higher quality of life,

            "For two generations now, well-meaning white people have subscribed
            to color blindness in an optimistic attempt to wish away the
            existence of structural racism. But when they do, they unwittingly
            align themselves with, and give mainstream cover to, a powerful
            movement to turn back the clock on integration and equality...
            'reactionary color blindness' has become the weapon of choice for
            conservatives in the courts and in politics. Racial conservatives
            on the Supreme Court have used the logic to rule that it's racist
            for communities to voluntarily integrate schools, because to do so,
            the government would have to 'see' race to assign students.
            Well-funded political groups mount campaigns to forbid the
            government from collecting racial data because isn't that what a
            racist would do? Instead of being blind to race, color blindness
            makes people blind to racism, unwilling to acknowledge where its
            effects have shaped opportunity or to use race-conscious solutions
            to address it" (229-230).

          <p>
            Color blindness has been the frame of choice in numerous pedagogies
            throughout America. But while it may be "optimistic," color
            blindness, alongside "why can't we all just get along?", is a
            non-solution; a denial; an out. Instead of being blind to race,
            color blindness makes people blind to racism. Rather than treating
            everyone equally and justly, we perpetuate the system that oppresses
            people of color and claim we were unaware. As has been seen again and
            again with the zero-sum story, this kind of denial disproportionately
            harms Black people but causes suffering for white people as well.
            Simply avoiding the realities of racism leaves people unable to
            "listen deeply to unexpected ideas expressed by people from other
            cultures," unwilling to examine their own biases and blindspots, and
            unprepared for a diverse society. Color blindness is not the answer.
            So where do we go from here?

            Empathy serves as a normative ideal for a rehumanized view of the
            other.... Importantly, this ideal of empathy is not achieved in an
            intense moment of sympathy, but in living together and genuinely
            attending to another's perspective over time. Such an understanding
            seems to be the basis of genuine social cooperation.

          The answer lies in empathy, or what McGhee calls the Solidarity
          Dividend: when people come together across boundaries of race, class,
          and age to change the dominant narrative of society from a zero sum
          to a positive sum. She gives the example of a multiracial coalition
          starting in a town in Maine:

        <span class="quote">
          <p>
            "Maine has experienced a Solidarity Dividend. Rejecting the
            scapegoating politics that enabled a right-wing government to
            deny healthcare and creating new political alliances between workers
            of all backgrounds resulted in sixty thousand Mainers winning
            access to healthcare. These same organizers and volunteers helped
            elect a wave of new politicians the following year, who passed
            reforms to address the opioid epidemic and guarantee a generous
            paid-time-off law for Maine workers. The next frontier of
            cross-racial coalition building, though, is for white people not
            just to stop voting against their own interests, but to vote for the
            interests of people of color, too, on issues of racial justice" (269).

            When groups begin to empower themselves—by learning more about
            each other, by unlearning old myths and stereotypes, by challenging
            the status quo—we make the difficult decision to interrupt the
            cycle of socialization. We begin to question the givens, the
            assumptions of the society, the norms, the values, the rules, the
            roles, and even the structures. As we attempt this, it becomes
            obvious that we cannot do it alone. We must build coalitions with
            people who are like us and people who are different from us. We will
            not be the minority if we work in coalitions. We will gain the
            necessary vision and power to reconstruct new rules that truly are
            equal, roles that complement each other instead of competing,
            assumptions that value all groups instead of ascribing value to
            some and devaluing others, and structures that promote cooperation
            and shared power instead of power over each other.

          Change needs to happen at every level of American society, but it
          starts in communities. It starts in multiracial cooperatives that
          traverse boundaries and identities. It starts with unlearning the
          zero-sum story that Black people cannot survive and thrive without
          costing white people and replacing it with a story of empathy, of
          human connection, of finding the Third, of coalitions, of justice.
          Only then can we truly live up to the ideals we aspire towards as
          a nation.

        That is our destiny. To make it manifest, we must challenge ourselves
        to live our lives in solidarity across color, origin, and class; we must
        demand changes to the rules in order to disrupt the very notion that
        those who have more money are worth more in our democracy and our
        economy. Since this country's founding, we have not allowed our
        diversity to be our superpower, and the result is that the United States
        is not more than the sum of its disparate parts. But it could be. And if
        it were, all of us would prosper. In short, we must emerge from this
        crisis in our republic with a new birth of freedom, rooted in the
