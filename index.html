          “The American landscape was once graced with resplendent public swimming pools, some big enough to hold thousands of swimmers at a time…. Officials envisioned the distinctly American phenomenon of the grand public resort pools as ‘social melting pots.’ Like free public grade schools, public pools were part of an ‘Americanizing’ project intended to overcome ethnic divisions and cohere a common identity—and it worked…. Of course, that vision of classlessness wasn’t expansive enough to include skin color that wasn’t, in fact, ‘all the same’" (23).

          <p>
            Public pools, like the one in Oak Park pictured above, used to be commonplace throughout the United States. But when Black families began demanding access to the public benefits their taxes were funding, towns opted to drain their pools rather than integrate them.
            As these grand, resort-like pools began closing across the country, white policymakers demonstrated that they would rather lose benefits for everyone than afford them to Black people.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Throughout <em>The Sum of Us</em>, Heather McGhee showed how time and again, America opted to drain the (metaphorical) pool of public benefits for everyone instead of allowing Black people access. From housing to healthcare to education to incarceration, America suffers from a lack of public benefits despite our uniquely advanced economy, and white people refuse to support public policy that would benefit them because it would also benefit Black people. The zero-sum story that progress for Black Americans must come at the expense of white Americans keeps us all from enjoying the healthcare, education, and democracy that the nation's ideals suggest. And until we address the fact that racism can be found at the heart of each of these seemingly unconnected issues, we will continue living in the bottom of a drained pool.

          “In the seventeenth century, influential Europeans were starting to create taxonomies of human beings based on skin color, religion, culture, and geography, aiming not just to differentiate but to rank humanity in terms of inherent worth. This hierarchy—backed by pseudo-scientists, explorers, and even clergy—gave Europeans moral permission to exploit and enslave. So, from the United States’ colonial beginnings, progress for those considered white did come directly at the expense of people considered nonwhite. The U.S. economy depended on systems of exploitation—on literally taking land and labor from racialized others to enrich white colonizers and slaveholders. This made it easy for the powerful to sell the idea that the inverse was also true: that liberation or justice for people of color would necessarily require taking something away from white people” (7).

            Racism is baked into every facet of American society, from the colonial origins of the nation—racism was used to justify stolen people, labor, and land—to our history of discrimination, segregation, and racial violence, to the current systems of healthcare, incarceration, higher education, etc. that are disproportionately harmful to Black people. This is no accident: for generations, the wealthy ruling class has capitalized on racist stereotypes to divide and conquer the working classes, pitting against each other people who would all benefit from improved public benefits.

            We are inundated with unquestioned and stereotypical messages that shape how we think and what we believe about ourselves and others. What makes this "brainwashing" even more insidious is the fact that it is woven into every structural thread of the fabric of our culture. The media... our language patterns, the lyrics to songs, our cultural practices and holidays, and the very assumptions on which our society is built all contribute to the reinforcement of the biased messages and stereotypes we receive.

          One of the most powerful influencers of individual and group belief systems in America—religion—is also responsible for maintaining mindsets of white supremacy. When Christian settlers came to America, they could not justify their actions towards Indigenous people and Africans if they were considered to be people "made in the image of God." So instead, Christians decided that they were not humans made in the image of God, that white people were, and that the stealing of land, labor, and people was justified. "It's this history of the American church's complicity with white supremacy that explains why, today, white Christians are about 30 percentage points more likely to hold racially resentful and otherwise racist views than religiously unaffiliated white people" (248).

            Since this original lie, American governments have repeatedly used race as a justification for disciminatory, oppressive action towards Black people at the benefit of white people. When racial resentment evolved from biological racism ("it's about who they are") to cultural disapproval ("it's about what most of them do"), the story shifted to be "colorblind." This story takes many forms: antigovernment ideologies (that are implicitly pro-white) paint white people as victims of a thieving government giving their money to "undeserving and lazy people of color in the ghettos" (32); politicians use terms like "forced busing" and "states' rights" and "cutting taxes" to disguise policies that cause disproportionate suffering to Black people; colleges require you to pay for school out of pocket, but family wealth is rooted in history, and Black families were historically denied the same wealth as white families; etc.

          The list of ways we have drained the pool is long, but one of the most important (and most controversial) examples is public college.
        </p>
        <div class="image-row">
          <img src="https://www.earnest.com/blog/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cost-of-college-keeps-rising.jpg" alt="Costs of college have risen steadily since 1975">
          <p>
            When the college-attending population was primarily white in the 1940s, '50s, and '60s, state and federal government funds were widely available to pay for the expenses of higher education. As the demographics of the American public became more diverse, state governments began drastically reducing funding for public college. As tuition has steadily increased since the late 20th century, student debt has skyrocketed, leaving millions of students struggling to pay off student loans.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          “Because wealth is largely shaped by how much money your parents and grandparents had, Black young adults’ efforts at higher education and higher earnings aren’t putting much of a dent in the racial wealth gap. This generation was born too late for the free ride, and student loan repayment is making it even harder for Black graduates’ savings and assets to catch up. In fact, white high school dropouts have higher average household wealth than Black people who’ve graduated from college.
          <br>
          <br>
          As with so many economic ills, student debt is most acute among Black families, but it has now reached 63 percent of white public college graduates as well and is having ripple effects across our entire economy” (43).
        </p>
        <div class="image-row">
          <p>
            When public college was a mark of pride for the American public, states "saw a return of three to four dollars back for every dollar [they] invested in public colleges" (42). But public policy changes forged from a zero-sum mindset of racism created a new "debt-for-diploma" system. Since federal and state funding for publc college has decreased, younger generations are left with less wealth and fewer ways to increase it. They cannot buy a home (the "irreplacable wealth-building asset"), they get married later, and they have less saved for retirement later in life. The economic returns we used to see from a well-educated public have vanished.

            There’s this one example, from 1931, where a light-skinned black man gets into a car accident, and he’s taken to a white hospital. It’s Grady Memorial Hospital. This is in Atlanta. And doctors there, they mistake him for a white patient, so they start treating him. And it’s only when his family comes to the hospital that they realize he’s actually black. So what do they do? They pull him off the examining table and they send him to the black ward across the street, where he later dies.

          Racism has had a strong grasp on American healthcare for decades. Black women are three times more likely to die of causes related to pregnancy than white women. Black people with H.I.V. get worse care than white people with the disease. Black patients with diabetes fared worse than white patients, even with the same doctor. Black Americans die at higher rates from cancers that would have been treatable had they been caught earlier.
